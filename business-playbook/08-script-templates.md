## Script Anatomy (4-Part Structure)

| Section | Time | Purpose | Psychology |
|---------|------|---------|------------|
| **Hook** | 0:00–0:03 | Stop the scroll | Open loop / pattern interrupt |
| **Setup** | 0:03–0:10 | Validate the hook | "Not clickbait, here's context" |
| **Value** | 0:10–0:50 | Deliver the goods | High density, no fluff, fast pacing |
| **CTA** | 0:50–1:00 | Tell them what to do | If you don't ask, they won't do it |

## Script Writing Guide

### Bad Example
```
"Welcome back to the channel. Today we're talking about tax strategy."
```

### Good Example
```
[VISUAL: Hold up stack of cash, then throw it off camera]
AUDIO: "Stop donating your money to the IRS."

[VISUAL: Green screen of IRS Tax Code website]
AUDIO: "There's a loophole on page 405 that nobody talks about..."
```

> **Key:** Always include visual cues so Person A isn't just a talking head.
