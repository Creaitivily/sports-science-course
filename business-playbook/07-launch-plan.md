# 30-Day Launch Plan

Build a "Content Moat" and test hypotheses fast using Short-Form Vertical Video.

## Content Pillars

Every video must fit one of these three buckets:

| Pillar | % of Content | Goal | Format |
|--------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Contrarian Expert** | 40% | Authority & Polarization | "Stop doing [X]. Here's what to do instead..." |
| **Tactical Teacher** | 40% | Trust & Utility | "The exact 3-step framework I use to [Result]..." |
| **Relatable Human** | 20% | Connection & Likability | "I messed up big time today..." |

## Week-by-Week Execution

### Week 1: Buffer Week (No Posting)

**Goal:** Film enough content to be 2 weeks ahead.

| Person B | Person A |
|----------|----------|
| Research and script 10 videos | Film all 10 in one "Golden Batch" session |
| Set up social accounts (bios, links) | — |

**Output:** 10 polished assets ready to go.

---

### Week 2: Soft Launch (5 Posts)

**Goal:** Test the posting workflows.

| Schedule | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Post 5 videos (from Week 1 batch) | Mon-Fri, 1x daily |

| Person B | Person A |
|----------|----------|
| Monitor comments and engagement | Film next batch of 5 |
| Script 5 new videos based on feedback | — |

**Metric:** Are automations working? Video quality on mobile?

### Week 3: Volume Week (7 Posts)

**Goal:** Analyze retention data.

| Schedule | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Post 7 videos | Daily |

| Person B | Person A |
|----------|----------|
| Deep dive: retention graphs, drop-off points | Film batch of 7 |
| Identify hook/CTA issues | — |

**Analysis Questions:**
- Drop off at 3 seconds? → Hooks are weak
- Drop off at end? → CTA is too long

### Week 4: Iteration Week

**Goal:** Double down on winning format.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Review Winners | Which pillar performed best? |
| Adjust Strategy | Shift ratio (e.g., 60% Contrarian if that won) |
